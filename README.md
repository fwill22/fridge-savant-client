## Project Goals
----------------------------------------
- To build a product with clean, professional UX.
- To learn a new tech stack (MERN)
- Support each other's learning.
- 95% Test coverage
- Work as a team in an agile environment.
- Have fun!

----------------------------------------
## Reflections
----------------------------------------

Challenges:  
- Time pressures made it difficult for each team member to get experience over the full stack. 
- TDD in React 
- Building good React components

Learnings:
- Better to focus on a smaller set of features to maintain quality and scalability
- Keep pull requests and merges small and manage them frequently for smooth progression
- It doesnâ€™t take very long to develop a feature past where the rest of your team can understand it, detailed retros and standups are vital
- Even with strong planning, time is always in short supply
- It's ok to build a temporary stage of a feature as long as there is a plan for improvement
- Good communication underpins everything. 

----------------------------------------
## Progression Ideas
----------------------------------------
-  Pantry management system
- Integration with online shopping systems
- Web scraping
